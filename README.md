An Android Mobile App developed for assessment at Victoria University

The API was provided by Victoria University. If you are experiencing timeout errors, or internal server errors, take it up with VU administration. Not me.

The API returns different keys based on which user has logged-in, however I have implemented dynamic JSON mapping with Moshi.

UI formatting was taken either from my previous assignment (log-in screen), or from the recyclerview example provided by VU (dashboard and details screen) with minor modifications made.
All credit to original authors.

Feel free to do whatever you want with this codebase.
I will leave it up as apart of my portfolio, as I am proud of this project.
